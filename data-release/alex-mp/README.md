We applied the following modifications to the data:
* Exclude structures containing the elements `Tc`, `Pm`, or any element with atomic number 84 or higher.
* Relax structures with DFT using a PBE functional in order to have consistent energies.
* For the training set, remove any structure with more than 20 atoms inside the unit cell.
* For the training set, remove any structure with energy above the hull higher than 0.1 eV/atom.
